<h1>Proposal 1 :</h1>

<h2>FriendNearMe - Housing Community Network Portal</h2>


<h3>Introduction to problem statement:</h3>
Residents of housing communities (like Avalon, 101 San Fernando, etc) often do not know other people living in the same community, sometimes not even their neighbours. Community members can often help each other when it comes to emergency situations, lending/borrowing things, making social connections or just making friends.

<h3>Abstract:</h3>
Maintaining a relationship with the people living close by but outside of one’s own family and friends can come handy in times of need. While most people will have accounts on social media websites, how can a resident know who lives around him/her? Even if the resident knows the name of the person, how can one search and connect on the social media website? This portal answers both the questions by providing that platform where people can get to know other people living in the same community. <br><br>

The following two points differentiate this portal from social media websites :<br>
1. All data is visible to and controlled by the housing community itself, which already has access to the residents’ housing data. It will not be accessible to any third party company.<br>
2. The members can be assured that all people on the portal belong to the community and are within reach, there are no strangers.

<h3>Approach:</h3>
=> The housing community will have added the details of the residents in the portal when the residents start their lease and then the residents can sign up using those credentials on the portal. <br><br>
=> Get friend recommendations based on the similarity of interests with other residents. (implemented using document similarity functionality in IBM Cloud DB for ElasticSearch)<br><br>
=> Residents sign up and enter their details and can view other residents’ details (as revealed by them).<br><br>
=> They can view the items available for borrowing / list items they want to lend.


<h3>Persona:</h3>
Housing Community Owner Persona - <br>
The entity that owns all the houses in the community can sign up and maintain the details of the current residents in the portal.
<br>
Resident Persona - <br>
The resident can sign up on the portal using the credentials provided by the housing community owner and create his profile.


<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
Server side - NodeJS, Express <br>
Client side - React <br>
Database - Cloudant <br>
Cloud and containerization - AWS EC2, AWS ECR, AWS ECS, Docker <br>
Similarity score functionality - IBM Cloud Databases for Elasticsearch  <br>


<h1>Proposal 2 :</h1>
<h2>Fantasy Football league Web Application</h2>

<h3>Introduction to problem statement:</h3>
Football is the most followed sport in the world and people love betting on their teams chances of winning.

<h3>Abstract:</h3>
Hence we intend to make a full-fledged web based application having all the information about football teams and their past and futures fixtures. Users can login to the application and based on teams past performance they can bet on their chances of winning in the upcoming fixtures.<br><br>

<h3>Approach:</h3>
We aim to adopt the following methodology in order:<br>
1) Design the database schema to store Team information, Fixtures, Betting information.<br>
2) Create the backend functionality using NodeJs.<br>
3) Create frontend functionality using ReactJs.<br>
4) Use TensorFlow.Js for betting recommendation.<br>
5) Deploy the application on AWS.<br>

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
We intend to use, but not limited to the following technologies for this project: <br>
1) MongoDB database <br>
2) Express.js <br>
3) React <br>
4) Node.js <br>
5) Amazon Web Services <br>

<h1>Proposal 3 :</h1>
<h2>Fitness Web Application</h2>

<h3>Introduction to problem statement:</h3>
With the growing number of activities, a person is becoming more and more busy everyday. This seriously affects the lifestyle of the individual and directly impacts his/her health. In today’s fast paced world it is difficult to find time to drive to and fro to a gym or a park for exercise. One way to keep up with health and save some if not all the time is to have a quick exercise session at home. Exercise alone is not enough, a proper diet is equally important for an individual’s well being. However, not everyone is aware of the nutrient values of the food they eat.

<h3>Abstract:</h3>
This project aims at solving these two problems by creating and deploying a web application that generates workout routines based on a person’s current physical body and future goals and also provides a proper diet plan.<br><br>

<h3>Approach:</h3>
We aim to adopt the following methodology in order:<br>
1) Create a layout of the web views so that a user can successfully signup/login, enter his/her information and generate workout routines and diet plans.<br>
2) Design the database schema to store user information, exercises data and food’s nutritional values.<br>
3) Create a backend server.<br>
4) Merge backend server with web views on the frontend to display dynamic data.<br>
5) Set up secure login for users.<br>
6) Deploy the application.<br>

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
We intend to use, but not limited to the following technologies for this project: <br>
1) MongoDB database <br>
2) Express.js <br>
3) React <br>
4) Node.js <br>
5) Amazon Web Services <br>

<h1>Proposal 4 :</h1>
<h2>Recruiting Web Application having Tinder Like UI</h2>

<h3>Problem and Goals:</h3>
With thousands of applicants applying for a job position, it is very difficult to keep track of all the applicants applied and the number of 	applicants selected/rejected in a particular round. Many recruiting platforms that are there today don’t provide an intuitive UI which makes the recruitment process as a recruiter and applying for jobs as a job seeker, boring and tedious. We intend to make a full-fledged web based application having all the necessary features needed for recruiting which will also recommend the suitable candidates to the recruiter and suitable jobs to the job seeker. This web app will have an intuitive UI just like Tinder where the recruiter/candidate can swipe left and right the candidates/job opening respectively.

<h3>Methodology:</h3>
We aim to adopt the following methodology in order:
1)	Design the database schema to store candidate information, Job information, Recruitment Process information.
2)	Create the backend functionality using NodeJs.
3)	Create frontend functionality using ReactJs.
4)	Use TensorFlow.Js for recommendation.
5)	Deploy the application on AWS.

<h3>Technologies:</h3>
We intend to use, but not limited to the following technologies for this project:
1)	MongoDB database
2)	Express.js
3)	React
4)	Node.js
5)	Amazon Web Services
